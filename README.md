# My First Website  

## Introduction  

When I decided to retrain as a web developer, I looked for a simple and concrete first project to work on. My neighbor, a self-employed nurse, entrusted me with creating her website.  

In France, the nursing profession is strictly regulated in terms of communication and advertising. Healthcare professionals are not allowed to promote their services.  

The goal was to design a showcase website highlighting the services offered, the area of intervention, and contact information.

## Development Steps  

1. **Designing the mockup in Figma**: defining the color palette, selecting typography, and organizing the pages.  
2. **Integrating the website using HTML and CSS** in VS Code.  
3. **Publishing the website** with OVH hosting.  

## Next Improvements  

To enhance the websiteâ€™s visibility, I plan to work on search engine optimization (SEO) so that it appears on the first or second page of Google search results for queries like **"infirmiere Versailles"**.
